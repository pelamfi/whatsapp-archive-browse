# Git attributes for consistent line endings across platforms

# Ensure all text files use LF (Unix-style) line endings in the repository
# but allow Git to convert to native line endings on checkout (if needed)
* text=auto

# Force specific files to always use LF line endings
# This is important for demo data and test reference files
demo-chat/_chat.txt text eol=lf
tests/resources/**/*.txt text eol=lf

# Ensure JSON reference files also have consistent line endings
tests/resources/**/*.json text eol=lf

# Binary files should not be converted
